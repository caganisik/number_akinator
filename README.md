Hello everyone, I am a computer engineering student at Atilim University in Turkey. 
My aim is learn new languages and create a few projects to develop myself. I believe i can do it. 
This project is actually a basic number akinator. You will choose a number in your mind and code show a number if it is your number. If it is not your choice, akinator will increase or decrease the number which akinator showed until it find your choice.
Thank you.
